# Python Intelligence Detective

## Project Overview
Python Intelligence Detective is a gamified learning platform designed to teach Python programming in an interactive and immersive way. Users assume the role of a cyber detective solving digital anomalies within simulated network environments. Each case file acts as a learning module, progressively teaching Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, recursion, lists, and dictionaries, while promoting logical thinking and problem-solving.

## Features
- Secure User Accounts: Learners and instructors can register and log in securely with local password hashing.
- Case-Based Learning: Unlock cases sequentially; each case introduces specific Python programming concepts.
- Interactive Python Execution: Learners can write and execute Python code to solve investigative puzzles.
- Evidence Analysis: Parse logs, extract patterns, and manipulate datasets using Python.
- Progress Dashboard: Visualize completed cases, points earned, and badges collected.
- Leaderboards: Compare performance with other learners.
- Heatmap Visualizations: View anomaly levels across nodes with dynamic charts.
- Gamification: Earn points and badges for code correctness, efficiency, and completion.
- Offline Local Storage: All data is saved locally in JSON files, fully functional without internet.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
2. Install required packages:
